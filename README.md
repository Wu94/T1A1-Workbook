# Jeremy Wu T1A1 Workbook Assignment

## Q1 Research the development of the internet from 1980 to today. You must describe at least FIVE key events in the development of the internet. You can refer to events, people of significance, or technologies and how they have changed over time.

### NSFNET - 1985

In 1985 the National Science Foundation sponsored the NSFNET project, which was used to support and promote networking in the United States research and education institutions. In the beginning the national supercomputer centers and the National Center for Atmospheric Research joined the project while other companies joined later such as IBM, MCI and Merit Network. Due to the development of enhanced research and network services linked  universities, laboratories, government agencies and research centers worldwide. 

### The Web - 1990

In the 1990, the internet started to become largely available to the public as telephone lines could be used to connect to modems and then to a computer which would allow access to the network. In 1995 the restriction on the use of the internet was only to be commercial only was lifted  which helped grow the internet then the creation of the web happened gained a lot of popularity. In 1996, the Internet Archives were created by Brewster Kahle to preserve and provide access to nearly any website on the internet. 

### Defining the term Internet - 1995

The Federal Networking Council had reached an agreement of what the definition of the internet was, on the 24th of October 1995. It was defined as a global information system that is linked together by a network with unique addresses known as Internet Protocol and also Transmission Control Protocol.

### The creation of the first pop-up advertisement  - 1996

The creation of the pop-up advertisement was made by Ethan Zuckerman in 1996. A pop-up advertisement is when the user is on a website and sees adverts that are mostly not related to the site itself posted around the web page. Pop-up also used the users personal homepages to target advertisements more to the users liking.   
 
### Mobile phones and the Internet - 1999

Instead of accessing the internet by a PC, in 1996 users in Finland were able to access the internet via the Nokia 9000 Communicator mobile device but in 1999 was considered to be the birth of mobile internet as it became more popular as more different mobile phone companies decided to create devices that could use the internet. 

## Q2 Define the features of the following technologies that are essential in terms of the development of the internet:

### Packets

Packets are a type of data that is sent from one computer, over the internet to another computer. The data can consist of anything that is moved across the internet via devices that can connect to the internet such as emails, blog posts, facebook messages, youtube videos or multiplayer games.

### IP Addresses (IPv4 & Ipv6)

IP also known as Internet Protocol, is a set of unique numbers that is assigned to a device that is connected to the internet which is used as a location or address of the user's device. IPv4 is the fourth version of the Internet Protocol, which is a 32-bit number that has been used since 1983 till today. IPv6 is the sixth version of the Internet Protocol and the successor to IPv4, it uses 128 bits for its IP addresses. 

### Routers and Routing

A router is a device that is used for connection points between sub-networks. It is used in both local area networks known as LAN and wide area networks known as WAN. Routing is known for two types of routes which are static tables and dynamic tables. Static tables are used to send packets to an IP address from a device and dynamic tables are for heavy network traffic which are updated commonly to create different routes to IP addresses.  

### Domains and DNS

Domains are servers that hold information for websites, such as code, images and videos that are connected to the internet.  Domains are basically an alias for an IP address, for example, youtube.com is the name of the website and its IP address is 208.65. 153.238. 208.65. DNS also known as Domain Name System is used to translate a IP address which records different individual services that are hosted on a domain. 

## Q3 Define the features of the following technologies that are essential in terms of the development of the internet:

### TCP 

TCP also known as Transmission Control Protocol is a set of rules used for devices to communicate to the internet. TCP is a system that is used to error check and orders to deliver data packets between a program running on a device to an IP network. The United States Department of Defense created TCP to control how devices would send data to other devices. The World Wide Web, emails and files transfers need to use TCP as it is a part of a transport layer as it is reliable.  TCP is split into four different layers known as a data link protocol, these different layers are called the data link, internet, transport and application layers. The data link layer is used for sending and receiving physical layers of data of hardware in a computer. The internet layer is used to manage the direction of data packets in the network. The transport layer is used to create a connection between devices to send and receive reliable data. The Application layer is the application that is used in communicating in the network. 
 
### HTTP and HTTPS 

HTTP also known as hypertext transfer protocol is used to communicate to two different systems, which is mostly used for sending data from a web server to a browser to view a web page. With HTTP, data that is transferred between systems is not encrypted and allows third parties to gather data between the systems. HTTPS which is known as hypertext transfer protocol secure is encrypted data that uses a SSL certificate. The SSL is defined as a secure sockets layer which is a digital document known as X.509 certificates that writes an encrypted key to websites, which makes a secure authentication between the web server and the web browser. If HTTPS did not exist, all data that is passed through the web would be insecure. From example, websites such as online banking, online shopping, government website such as medicare and centrelink would need HTTPS as it is passing sensitive or personal information such as credit card details, drivers licenses, passports or medical records.   

### Web browsers (requests, rendering and developer tools)

A web browser is an application used to access anything on the web which can be used on devices that have access to the internet. There are alot of different types of web browsers such as Google chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge and Apple Safari. A request in a web browser is defined as the user using a web browser and accessing a website which the user is requesting the text, images, files and etc, which goes on to rending means the website is loading the text, images, files and etc onto the page as requested from the user. There are steps to rending which includes the style, layout, paint and composting of the website. These steps are combined into a rendering tree that creates the layout of everything that needs to be loaded onto the web page. For developers to test and debug code such as HTML, CSS and Javascript on a website, they would use web development tools. Most web development tools are built in web browsers. 

## Q4 Identify THREE data structures used in the Ruby programming language and explain the reasons for using each.

### Arrays

In ruby an array is a group of data that starts at an index of zero. The syntax for an array in ruby is “[]” which data can be placed inside the brackets such as numbers and objects.  For example if “arry = [Fish, Beef, Chicken, Lamb]” and the user wanted to acquire the beef object in the array, the user would use the index one as an array starts at a index of zero. 

### Hashes 

In ruby a hash is a group of unique keys which can be a string, integer symbol or a value. The syntax for a hash in ruby is “{}” which data can be placed in between the brackets. Example use for a hash would be if the user wanted a deck of cards in their application, as a card has a value, symbol and name. For example the card king of heart in the game blackjack has a value of 10, symbol of hearts and a name of king. 

### Binary Tree 

A binary tree is a concept of linked data structures which is made of nodes that refers to left or right data and the top node is called the root. Binary trees are mainly used for data compression, routing tables and Abstract syntax trees. Compared to an array or hash, binary trees are uncommonly used as the use of arrays and hashes are more helpful in applications.  Example of Binary tree below: 

## Q5 Describe the features of interpreters and compilers and how they are different.

### Interpreters 

An interpreter is defined as a program that converts code into machine code while still allowing code to be written for machines that are still being made and tested. Both Interpreters and compilers are quite similar which the Ruby programming language is known to do both but the main difference would be that  interpreters allow line by line coding while the program is still running, an example of a common interpreter language that is widely used is Python. 

### Compilers 

A compiler is defined as a program that can convert high level code written into lower level programming languages such as Javascript, Java, C and C++. This allows machine code to be more efficient when used than interpreted languages which gives developers more control of hardware, such as RAM and CPU usage.  A java compiler to convert Java code into Java Bytecode which can be run in Java Virtual Machine. The difference between an interpreter and a compiler is that a compiler is used to translate code into efficient machine code, while an interpreter is used to run code directly in the programming language.  

## Q6 Identify TWO commonly used programming languages and explain the benefits and drawbacks of each.

### Python 

The programming language Python was created by Guido van Rossum in the 1990s but is now one of the most popular high level and general purpose programming languages that developers use for projects and also by companies such as Google, Facebook. Microsoft, Mozilla and etc. Python is an open source program that focuses on being readable and well structured that has a large active community that has very supportive forums that help users learn the programming language with ease such as frameworks and examples. The main uses for Python are for data science, data analytics, enterprise application, web development and artificial intelligence.  In the United States job market, Python is in the highest demand programming language. The pros of using Python is that it is an interpreter language which allows developers to write code while the project is under construction and test. Also since Python is a very popular programming language, first time users can pick it up easily as active forums and websites such as https://docs.python.org/3/ that have tutorials. The cons of Python is that it is slower than other languages due to it being an interpreter language.  Also Python is not native to the mobile environment out of the box as additional steps need to be taken for the users to create projects for mobile.     

### JavaScript 

The programming language JavaScript was first developed by Brendan Eich to create a programming language for web browsers. In 2009 Ryan Dahl released a cross platform version of JavaScript to run on side servers with JavaScript runtime Node j.s. Also in 2010 Google had released AngularJS which is a web development based javascript program. The advantages of JavaScript is easy to learn and use as it is structured well and also very popular as it supports most web browsers and large companies such as Google and Amazon use it. JavaScript is also rich in functionality, for example Greasemonkey which is a third party extension for Mozilla Firefox that allows users to add predefined code to save time. JavaScript is versatil as NodeJS allows users to do back end development while AngularJS allows users to do front end development. The disadvantages of  JavaScript is client side security as other users can implement malicious code onto a website that can compromise the data. Most old browsers do not support all functions of JavaScript which can lead to a compatibility problem. When using JavaScript, debugging can be an issue as some web browsers do not support debugging and may be hard for the user to find the error which can lead to the whole web page to not render as one piece of code can break the whole site.  

## Q7 Identify TWO ethical issues from the areas below and discuss the extent to which an IT professional is ethically responsible in terms of the issue.

### Access to a user’s personal information (medical, family, financial, personal attributes such as sexuality, religion, or beliefs).

Personal information is defined to be very broad as there different types of personal information. For example personal information can be sensitive information that is about an individual's credit information, tax file number, employee record, health information, race, religious beliefs or criminal record. In 1988 the Privacy Act had been introduced to promote and protect people's privacy and it is regulated by government agencies and organisations. The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner website defines and describes examples of personal information and guidelines of when it is breached.  
This will be able to help a developer to act ethical or if needed guidance or examples of breaches or correct use of personal information. For example if a developer created an online shopping website, it would most likely need personal details such as credit card information to purchase items on the site. Which the site would need to use some type of encryption such as HTTPS or SSL certificate, so no third party could take the customers credit card details when purchasing items on that website. If the site was not secure both the site owner and consumer would be liable for breach of privacy as the consumer did not check if the website encrypted or safe to use and the owner not using a secure website or could be doing that on purpose to acquire personal information for malicious use.    

### Intellectual property, copyright, and acknowledgement.

Intellectual property is defined as a new idea that you or someone has created which can be a trade mark, design, brand or invention. The Australian Intellectual property website defines different types of intellectual property and guidelines of how to protect it. The ethical issue here would be if a developer creates an original idea and someone else has taken it to use for profit without consent of the owner or the original creator. For a developer to overcome this problem, they would need to apply for a formal application to own the right to intellectual property but before this is done, they need to understand intellectual property rights which can vary between different types of intellectual property. To keep intellectual property safe before applying for ownership, it is best to keep the idea to yourself or if you are working with others, it is best to create a non-disclosure agreement to prevent your idea from being taken without permission. Copyright is a type of intellectual property that is protected by the Copyright Act developed in 1968, that gives an owner rights to use the intellectual property. Copyright property can be used by others if the owner allows it as there may or may not be payment to involved. 

### Conduct research into a case study of ONE of the ethical issues you have chosen and discuss how an ethical IT professional should respond to the case study and how they might mitigate or prevent ethical breaches. 

In this scenario, issues that need to be looked into are the career centers contract or agreement with the external service provider, which may outline the use of personal information that the students provide on their profiles. To prevent breaches of personal information being shared, an IT professional would create a term and conditions that the students can look at before signing up or complete creating the profile to the career center and also seek agreement between the career center and the external service provider that the student information that is used, will only be used within the career center as this would mitigate the breach of privacy of the students. Another issue would be what personal information is needed to be provided in the profiles which some information could be not needed. For instance if the students information was used for things other than information tailored to users experience with a system being able to provide individual career interest, this would be a breach of intellectual property and would be able seek legal action to compensate the breach of personal information. An IT professionals would make sure that non-essential detail should not be placed into the career center profile when creating a profile builder page and also make sure that the data is encrypted so no third party could not easily access the students personal information used for malicious applications. Would also need to know how staff members of the career center would direct the correct information to students they feel safe that their information has been taken advantage of in other applications. For staff members to be able to relay correct information to students, they would need training or information about privacy of personal information and defined uses of how the information is used and that it will not breach the students rights of personal information being used for something else. To mitigate or prevent these things to happen an IT professional would create a frequently ask questions page on the career center website to be able to relay information to students in a easy understandable way that student can easily read and understand which would hopefully make students to be more comfortable about their personal information to be for their individual career purposes. In conclusion for students to feel safe about their personal information to be only used for career purposes, an agreement must be developed between the career center and external provider so that if there is a breach of use of the student information, that legal action can be seeked to compensate for damages. Also for the student and staff members to be able acquire correct information of how the student information is used so students or staff won't be misled or given misleading information.   

## Q8 Explain control flow, using an example from the Ruby programming language

A control flow in programming languages is used to direct statements in a certain order from start to finish. In ruby, control flow is most commonly used in if/elif and else statements.

image

In the example above shows statements of win conditions in a blackjack game. At the start an if statement is alway first as it asks if the dealer hand is greater than 21 which refers to a boolean.  Then after the first if, can either go to elsif statement which is another if statement but continues to check the next statement or to an else statement which is used at the end which it finds the opposite of the if/elsif statements.

## Q9 Explain type coercion

A type coercion is defined as a function that changes the expression from one data type to another which could be a string. Integer or s float. An example of this happening in ruby would be 1.to_s would equal to string of 1.

## Q10 Explain data types, using examples

### Boolean 

A boolean has a value of true or false which is used in programming languages to find the answer of a statement. For example if 4 > 6 represents a true or false statement which in this case would be true as 4 is not greater than 6. 

### Numeric 

A numeric type of data consists of either an integer or a float. The difference between the two is that a float has a decimal point or to be fraction while an integer does not. 

image 

The example above shows that x is an integer while y is a float. 

### String

A string data type is usually a word or group of letters from the alphabet. For example my string = “this is a string” is the most basic definition of a string. 

## Q11 Here’s the problem: “There is a restaurant serving a variety of food. The customers want to be able to buy food of their choice. All the staff just quit, how can you build an app to replace them?”

### Identify the classes you would use to solve the problem.

### Write a short explanation of why you would use the classes you have identified.

If all staff have quit, we must determine every role that is needed to run a restaurant. A manager class is needed to train employees, purchase stock, sort payroll. Which would lead to an employee class which can be a super class as jobs types can be split up into classes such as cook, wait staff, cleaner. The cook class would take on different types of food that can be cooked, the wait staff class to sort out takeaway or dine in customers. The cleaner class can be split into different types of cleaning such as dishwashing, mopping the floor and cleaning the bathroom. 

## Q12 Identify and explain the error in the code snippet below that is preventing correct execution of the program.

Image

The error in this code snippet is celsius = gets as in the ruby programming language, gets is used for user input which is default data type would be a string and string cannot be called as we are look celsius which number or a integer which to make the this line of code work, is to change gets to gets.to_i. As this will change the string to integer allowing the user to input a number that can be converted to fahrenheit.

## Q13 The code snippet below looks for the first two elements that are out of order and swaps them; however, it is not producing the correct results. Rewrite the code so that it works correctly.

### Code snippet 

image

### The correct code

Image

## Q14 Demonstrate your algorithmic thinking through completing the following two tasks, in order:

### Create a flowchart to outline the steps for listing all prime numbers between 1 and 100 (inclusive). Your flowchart should make use of standard conventions for flowcharts to indicate processes, tasks, actions, or operations

image 

### Write pseudocode for the process outlined in your flowchart

image

## Q15 Write pseudocode OR Ruby code for the following problem:

### You have access to two variables: raining (boolean) and temperature (integer). If it’s raining and the temperature is less than 15 degrees, print to the screen “It’s wet and cold”, if it is less than 15 but not raining print “It’s not raining but cold”. If it’s greater than or equal to 15 but not raining print “It’s warm but not raining”, and otherwise tell them “It’s warm and raining”.

Image

## Q16 An allergy test produces a single numeric score which contains the information about all the allergies the person has (that they were tested for). The list of items (and their value) that were tested are:

 - eggs (1)
 - peanuts (2)
 - shellfish (4)
 - strawberries (8)
 - tomatoes (16)
 - chocolate (32)
 - pollen (64)
 - cats (128)

So if Tom is allergic to peanuts and chocolate, he gets a score of 34.

### Write a program that, given a person’s score can tell them:

 a) whether or not they’re allergic to a given item
 b) the full list of allergies.
